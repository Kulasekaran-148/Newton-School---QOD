Problem Statement
Newton has A cookies, and Einstein has B cookies. Newton will do the following action K times:

1) If Newton has one or more cookies, eat one of his cookies.
2) Otherwise, if Einstein has one or more cookies, eat one of Einstein's cookies.
3) If they both have no cookies, do nothing.

In the end, how many cookies will Newton and Einstein have, respectively?
Input
The first line of the input contains 3 integers, A, B and K

Constraints:
1) 0 ≤ A ≤ 1012
2) 0 ≤ B ≤ 1012
3) 0 ≤ K ≤ 1012
Output
Print the number of Newton's and Einstein's cookies after K actions.
Example
Sample Input 1:
2 3 3

Sample Output 1:
0 2

Sample Explanation 1:
Newton will do the following:

1) He has two cookies, so he eats one of them.
2) Now he has one cookie left, and he eats it.
3) Now he has no cookies left, but Einstein has three, so Newton eats one of them.

Thus, in the end, Newton will have 0 cookies, and Einstein will have 2.
