Problem Statement
We have N+M balls, each of which has an integer written on it.
It is known that:

1) The numbers written on N of the balls are even.
2) The numbers written on M of the balls are odd.

Find the number of ways to choose two of the N+M balls (disregarding order) so that the sum of the numbers written on them is even.
Input
The first and the only line of the input contains 2 space separated integers, N and M

Constraints:
1) 0 ≤ N, M ≤ 100
2) 2 ≤ N + M
